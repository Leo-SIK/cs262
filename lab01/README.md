CS 262 - Lab 1
This lab is based on 

hacks that I had to make https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/cs/262/kvlinden/01introduction/lab.html

Created App.js with simple Hello world.

Answers to the lab questions:

App.js: File that controls all the actual coding for the app

package.json: it is used to track different dependencies of projects and includes some scripts 

node_modules: it includes all of dependencies and packages that are needed for the project (installed packages will be here)

.gitignore: it helps git to keep tract of items based on the need
